Windows/Mac/*nix\r\n\r\nCan be run from the cli using run.php e.g php run.php or the writer.php class can be used standalone for embedding in a website - for instance.\r\n\r\n* Replace Text: [romfile] --replace [text] [replace]\r\n* Dump Text(Hex View): [romfile] --dump\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n======\r\n\r\n* The script doesn't currently support NES pointers, this means that the text you intend to replace can only be replaced with text of the same length or smaller.\r\n* The script has only been tested with Legend of Zelda NES and Super Mario Bros. NES. You can add custom mappings for iNES header titles or filenames in the \"config/mappings.php\" file and font tables for these mappings can be created based on \"./tables/generic.php\". If a font table cannot be found, NesWriter will prompt you for a file path to one. Support for .tpl...soon ;)\r\n* This is very experimental and was more of a learning process for me than anything else - so no promises that this script is anywhere near perfect ;)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
